      "| **Analyze** | 4. *Compare a Gradient‑Boosted Tree with a Random Forest for the task of predicting crop yield in the Indian state of Punjab using satellite‑derived NDVI and weather data. Discuss scenarios where one model may outperform the other, and analyze the impact of over‑fitting and interpretability.* | Students should discuss ensemble diversity, tree depth, number of estimators, and the effect of noisy features. |\n",
      "| **Evaluate** | 5. *A medical diagnostic dataset (Indian patients) was modeled using GBM. The reported metrics were: Accuracy = 0.88, Precision = 0.81, Recall = 0.75, F1‑score = 0.78. Critically evaluate whether this model is acceptable for a real‑world triage system in a rural hospital. Justify your answer using relevant domain considerations and possible improvements.* | Students must weigh trade‑offs between false positives/negatives, cost of misdiagnosis, and how to improve the model. |\n",
      "| **Create** | 6. *Design a complete Gradient‑Boosted Tree pipeline to predict daily electricity consumption for a metropolitan city in India (e.g., Mumbai). Your design should include: (a) data sources and preprocessing steps, (b) feature engineering (seasonality, holidays, weather), (c) hyper‑parameter tuning strategy, (d) evaluation plan (cross‑validation, error metrics), and (e) a deployment sketch (e.g., web API, edge device). Write a brief project proposal (≈300 words) outlining your approach.* | This question tests the student’s ability to synthesize knowledge, plan a realistic project, and consider practical constraints. |\n",
